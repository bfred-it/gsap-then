Once loaded, every GSAP tween (TweenLite, TimelineLite, TweenMax, TimelineMax) will automatically be a promise. See the [usage examples](#usage) to see what this enables.

## Install

```sh
npm install --save gsap-then
```

```js
import 'gsap';
import 'gsap-then';
```

Or include the file `dist/gsap-then.browser.js` after loading Greensock.

## Usage

```js
TweenLite.to('.title', 1, {opacity: 0}).then(function () {
	console.log('Done animating title');
})
```

## Notes

When you call `.then()` a new Promise is generated. 

- Simple tweens: the promise it's resolved with the callback `onComplete`
- Timelines: it's added to the timeline with `.add`

This has two limitations:

- Simple tweens: `.then` can only be called once and will override any previous `onComplete` callback.
- Timelines: `.then` doesn't mark the official completion of the timeline unless it's the last method you call.

These limitations are there because GSAP only supports one callback at a time (i.e. there can't be more than on `onComplete`).

## Dependencies

No dependencies except GSAP itself, but you need to load it separately. It works even if you only load TweenLite
